# Testing git
This is a repository where you can test and play with git, without creating chaos in the actual code ;-) 

(I) Decide on where you want to use git on your local computer/linux: command prompt or gui (example: github desktop, VS Code)

(II) Once you have decided you can train the following procedures

  (a) Cloning the repository and switching between branches. 
  (b) Fetch origin: update your local copy of the repository. (See how the new/changed documents are now saved on your computer)
