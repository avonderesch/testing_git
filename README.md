# Testing git
This is a repository where you can test and play with git, without creating chaos in the actual code ;-) 

If during the testing you notice that something in the [manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JhibwIaHHVdITBseGMIbSq1g5nHy6fbarBpNsaSCoUM/edit?usp=drive_link) was not explained good enough or needs to be added, please include it yourself or ask Alex to add it. 

(I) Decide on where you want to use git on your local computer/linux: command prompt or gui (example: github desktop, VS Code)

(II) Once you have decided you can train the following procedures

  - [ ] Cloning the repository and switching between branches.
        
  - [ ] Fetch origin: update your local copy of the repository. (See how the new/changed documents are now saved on your computer)
  
  - [ ] Edit an excisting document or add a new document to your working branch - commit these changes

  - [ ] Push changes to the remote; also try to retract your push (in case you have made a mistake) 

  - [ ] Performe a pull-merge request; see how it can be accepted/declined; see how potential merge conflicts are shown and how to resolve them

> [!NOTE]
> This step is especially important when merging to the main!

> [!NOTE]
> A merge conflict is usually indicated as the lines in the conflicting file with between these symbols: >>>>>>>       <<<<<<<<<. You can then manually adjust the code. In order to avoid having these conflicts, it is important to regurlary update the repository and commit all excisting changes.

Have fun using Git!
